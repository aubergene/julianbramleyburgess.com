						connections between equilibrium, geometry, and the human psyche. Through his captivating
						artworks, Burgess invites viewers on an introspective journey, prompting thoughtful
						reflection on the interplay of these elements. Drawing inspiration from the ethereal
						nature of dreams and the delicate balance of chaos and order, his creations offer
						glimpses into a realm where hierarchies dissolve and complex relationships intertwine.
						With a keen eye for form and a deep understanding of the human experience, Burgess&#39;s art
						challenges conventional boundaries, inviting viewers to question their perceptions and
						contemplate the mysteries of existence.</p></div></div></div></div>`;return{c(){e=c("section"),e.innerHTML=n,this.h()},l(t){e=h(t,"SECTION",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),m(e)!=="svelte-q1t30"&&(e.innerHTML=n),this.h()},h(){d(e,"class","section")},m(t,a){u(t,e,a)},p:s,i:s,o:s,d(t){t&&p(e)}}}class y extends o{constructor(e){super(),l(this,e,null,g,r,{})}}export{y as component};
